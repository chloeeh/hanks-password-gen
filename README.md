# wk3 - Password Generator

# Description
The purpose of this project is to use javascript to generate a random password based on user input and dynamically modiy the HTML shown on the webpage.

When the 'Generate Password' button is clicked the challenge is primarily fulfilled by using prompt(), alert(), and confirm() windows inside conditional statements; exploring ways to manipulate arrays, and organizing functions all built from the previous weeks of the bootcamp. 

When the website is opened (or when source code is opened in default browser), the following page should appear as shown in the image below.
